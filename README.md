The Clicky Game is a React.js memory game. This application is broken into UI components, manages component state, and responds to user click events.

### How It Works
* The object of the game is to click on an image only once, and the images reshuffle after each click in order to test your memory.
* The application renders different images to the screen, and each image listens for click events.
* The application keeps track of the user's score, and the user's score is increases by one point after clicking an image for the first time. 
* The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images reshuffle in a random order.
* The game restarts when the user makes an incorrect guess.
* When the user correctly clicks on every image once, they win and the game restarts.

### Technologies Used
